# Healthcare_IoT_Sloution

Healthcare technology is very popular in this pandemic situation because of coronavirus.

health care technology is rapidly being revolutionized with the help of the Internet of Things (IoT). Monitoring the health status of a patient (trainer)is a hard task because of our busy schedule and our daily work. Mostly, the elderly patients should be monitored periodically.

 So I thought to make an innovative system in this lockdown to automate the task. This device uses an ESP8266 webserver to track patient health using this monitoring system.

 Hence, patient health parameters such as body temperature, heart rate (BPM), blood oxygen levels (Sp02) as well as room temperature and humidity can be monitored from any device (like Smartphone, PC, Laptop, Smart TV,.) That support browsing capabilities.
